# Random Quote Machine

![App demo](demo.gif)

This is the first project for the freeCodeCamp.org [ Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects): a random quote generator.

I'm creating this to consolidate and further develop my understanding of React, in addition to enriching my portfolio. 
Doing this in parallel to the [School of Code bootcamp](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/).

I always choose to tailor projects to things I like and am interested in - in this case I have created an array of quotes taken from esoteric and spiritual texts, mainly by Rudolf Steiner but also other figures from Christian and non-Christian traditions.

  - Styling has been added. Now I'm working on learning how to deploy the app via Heroku.
